# team_project_roses
This group project is a Java application and MySQL database blood donation system. 
This application allows hospital staff to register, delete, update, and select patient 
information. It also allows to record and update blood donation history, both for 
donors and receivers. Each hospital staff has their own email and password to register in
the system. The sytem has multiple blood banks, where the patient can select their location
where they will do a donation or transfusion. The database also stores the stock of blood in 
units and blood types. The application is able to determine what are the compatible types
of blood for a receiver, and which blood is more suitable for them depending on the date 
the blood was donated on.
